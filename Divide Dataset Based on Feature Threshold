#Divide Dataset Based on Feature Threshold
"""Write a Python function to divide a dataset based on whether the value of a specified feature is greater than or equal to a given threshold. 
The function should return two subsets of the dataset: one with samples that meet the condition and another with samples that do not."""

    indices = np.where(X[:, feature_i] >= threshold)[0]
    new_arr = X[indices]
    new_arr2 = np.delete(X, indices, axis=0)
    return [new_arr, new_arr2]
